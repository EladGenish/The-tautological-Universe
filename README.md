Author’s Note
This paper was written and completed by Elad Genish in January 2026.
The arguments developed here arose from repeated encounters—across physics, cosmology, and philosophy of mind—with a recurring structural pattern in contemporary foundational theory. In multiple domains, ostensibly distinct frameworks were found to rely on the same methodological move: redefining a target phenomenon as emergent from a substrate that already presupposes the phenomenon’s defining structure.
The term Ontological Substitution is introduced in this paper to name and analyze that pattern. The aim is not to dispute specific empirical results or mathematical formalisms, but to clarify the ontological claims being made on their behalf. Accordingly, the critique is methodological and diagnostic rather than adversarial.
This work is original and independent. All unifying concepts, definitions, and diagnostic tools presented here—including the Metric Test and the Conditions of Persistence framing—were developed by the author and are first articulated together in this form in the present manuscript.
Readers are encouraged to approach this paper as a framework for evaluation rather than as a position to be accepted or rejected wholesale. The goal is not to deny the possibility of emergence, but to distinguish genuine emergence from circular restatement. If the analysis succeeds, it should render certain explanatory moves unavailable—not through refutation, but through clarification.
Any errors of interpretation or reasoning remain the responsibility of the author alone.
